_##Client report with the XYZ-books Kft. representatives

*Greeting, introduction between the client and the team members.

**Client:** Our company has been dealing with book sales in Hungary since 2015, serving the claim of the bookworm community, with competable prices, selling books in multiple languages. Our main problem is that we only have 2 shops in the country, in the capital Budapest and in Eger, and we want to expand, but for that we need to adapt tot he customs of the 21st century. We would like to have a webshop for now only in english later with selectable languages, that makes the process of buying a book more convenient to our customers, the webshop should be as user friendly as possible without any fancy animations and such. The customers shall have an own profile, making the shopping procedure even easier, as for the customers, who don’t want to have a profile, they shold be able to do the shopping without having one.

**Board Team:** For this, we need a registration form and to store the data of the users. Could you please share soem more information about your notions?

**Client:** As we said we would like the purchases to be independent from registration, so everyone should be able to shop ont he page, and add products to the shopping cart. Altough regular customers should have the opportunity to register, saving their username, email, fullname, date of birth, gender, password in order to use it later for identification or any other use. After they will have to use only their username and password to log in. Also, we would like to make the customer's job even easier, and we would like to offer the possibility of saving shipping data for registered users, so they will be asked later to use their basic shipping information, but they can also change it there of course.Also we would like to see when the user registered to our shop.The users should be able to using it’s email + password or username+ password. During the registration process the user should be able to give an address if he/she wants to where he/she wants to ship the books that he/she bought. Also the user should be able to get his/her forgotten password if necessary.The customer should be able to browse our shop from every country if possible, and also to order to and from any country.The registered users should be able to save books to their wishlist.

**Board Team:** Sending the forgotten password back to the user is not really possible, because of the encription process . We can do a reset password option instead. Also you said that the users should be able to log in using their email+password too, if we do that the user should be able to change their email, because this could lead to complications in the future.

**Client:** Yes please do that. When it comes to registering orders into the webshop and the database, our workers should be able to register new products and modify existing products, also remove products form the shop, this should be done by the Secretary, we also need a Support user that can make orders for books, modify or delete orders, and can see and modify the customers data if something wend wrong during the shopping process(for example the customer gave the wrong adress or email). Also we need a Supervisor profile that has all of the priviliges of the Secretary and the Support, and also can add Support or Secretary priviliges to our workers, also to see what kind of products and when were they added by the others, and maybe some statistycs about the sold books later in the future.

**Board Team:** That can be arranged. What about the books?

**Client:** Every book has a title, one or multiple authors, a publisher, a genre, a language, page number, an ISBN for international identification purposes, how many of that book we have in stock, or can be ordered and a price of said book. The customer has to be able to filter by the previously said tags, also filtering by price and page number should be done in an x-y interval and the page should list the products by 30 pieces on each page. Also since one book can have a multiple authors we need a system that doesn’t make a problem from this.

**Board Team:** All right, that greatly helps us designing the filter system. Now what about the webpage itself?

**Client:** We don’t want anything kytsch or silly design. We want a clean and easy to navigate site for convinient use. That being said the home page should welcome the customer by showing the 5 most popular books and the 5 nevest books in separate carousels, and some random books. An About Us page where the companys’ adress and such informations to be found. A shop page wher the customer can browse and filter the products. A profile page where the registered customer can modify their data, as you said they should be able to modify their email too to avoid complications in the future. A shopping cart page where the customer can see the products he/she placed to the cart listed by price and how many of that item is in the cart. A wishlist page where the registered users can see their books that they added tot he list, later maybe with a price watcher feature. A page where our customers can send us messages. An our shops page with a map where our shops are in the country, with their adress, phone number, and email adress. Shipping and pricing page, about this we can’t say much yet, because we still negotiating with shipping companys about offers, but in the next meeting we can provide the information. And an order and verification page.

**Board Team:** What about coupons and discounts?

**Client:** We don’t have anythig planned for that, but later would be really good feature.

**Board Team:** So about orders and verification?

**Client:** Yes about those. On the order page the customer could choose from the 2 purchasing options of shipping or personal taking in our shop, and also a choosable option if the customer is a private person or a company. If the customer chooses the shipping option there should be a form  with the following things to add: Full name, Country, City, Street and house  number, Postal Code, Misc(Floor, room number, gate code etc.), and an extra field for other information(when the customer can take their orders and such). If the customer is a company then the following form should pop up: Company name, Tax number, Country, City, Adress, Postal code,Misc. After the customer gave these information there should be a choosable option if the billing adress is the same as the shipping adress or not, if not show an another form tot he customer depending if the customer is a private person or a company.

**Board Team:** All right that is reasonable. Do you have anything specific about design? Like a specific color or shapes?

**Client:** No, we don’t , only that we would like our website to consist of light colors and clean design, the other stuff we leave to you.

**Board Team:** We see. We gladly accept the project. If you come up with any other ideas, feel free to message us. All of our members are eager to work together.
